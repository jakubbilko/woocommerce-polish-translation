Polish Woocommerce Translation
==============================

I noticed that a lot of things in the Polish translation for woocommerce suck, so I started improving it.

## What's changed?

- The 'on hold' order status was translated to 'Wstrzymane'
- The message when a coupon was used was changed to 'Kupon użyty pomyślnie.'

## Woocommerce version compatibility

This translation was tested with the 2.2.7 version o Woocommerce.
